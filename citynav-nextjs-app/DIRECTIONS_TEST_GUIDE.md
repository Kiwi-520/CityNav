# Essential Maps - Directions Feature Test Guide

## 🧪 Testing the Directions Feature

Your Essential Maps feature is now fully functional with working directions! Here's how to test it:

### **1. Access the Feature**

- Open your browser and go to: `http://localhost:3000/essential-maps`
- The page should load with an interactive map and POI list

### **2. Test Directions from POI List**

1. **Scroll down** to see the POI list at the bottom
2. **Click "Directions"** on any POI item (like "Phoenix Mall - Public Restroom")
3. **Allow location access** when prompted by your browser
4. The directions modal should open showing:
   - Route summary (distance & time)
   - Step-by-step directions
   - Multiple transport modes (Walking, Driving, Cycling)

### **3. Test Directions from Map**

1. **Click on any POI marker** on the map
2. In the popup, **click "Directions"**
3. The same directions modal should open

### **4. Test Transport Modes**

1. In the directions modal, try clicking:
   - 🚶 **Walking** - for pedestrian routes
   - 🚗 **Driving** - for car routes
   - 🚴 **Cycling** - for bike routes
2. Each mode should show different route calculations

### **5. Test External Navigation**

1. Click **"Open in Maps"** button
2. This should open:
   - **Android**: Google Maps app or web version
   - **iOS**: Apple Maps or Google Maps
   - **Desktop**: Google Maps in a new tab

## 🔧 **How It Works**

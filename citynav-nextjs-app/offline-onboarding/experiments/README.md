# Experiments

Batch runs against Overpass to measure latency, payload size, and POI counts by category across cities and radii.

Outputs (see project scripts/output/):
- overpass_results.csv — per-run metrics
- overpass_summary.csv — aggregated medians/p95s
- latency_chart.svg, payload_chart.svg — quick visuals

Use these artifacts for the research paper results section.

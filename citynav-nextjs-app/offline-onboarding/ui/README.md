# UI Overview (Offline Onboarding)

Key interactions:
- Toggle POI categories via legend (persisted filters).
- Create pack (dev utility) from current selection; inspect calculated pack size (gzipped when available).
- List and preview packs; load a pack to view POIs anywhere; delete when not needed.
- When offline, a nearby pack is auto-selected if it covers the current location.
- Select a POI marker to navigate; view route geometry, distance, ETA, and steps in the navigation panel.
